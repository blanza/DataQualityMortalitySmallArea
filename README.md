# Analyzing regional patterns of mortality data quality and adult mortality for small areas in Brazil, 1980-2010.


This repository contains code and data from our paper comparing levels of adult mortality across 558 harmonized small areas of Brazil, spanning from 1980 to 2010, considering alternative approaches to adjust death counts registration data. We assess the quality of data, combining demographic and statistical methodologies, available for these small areas and subsequently generate estimates of adult mortality. We compare differences in data quality by sex and regions and show how not considering data quality can impact substantive analysis of mortality. We propose a method that can be replicable to other countries with defective data.
